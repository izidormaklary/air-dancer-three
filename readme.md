# Airdancer animation

three.js animation with more advanced techniques

---
- skinned mesh 
- skeleton 
- bones
- animation mixer/clip
- keyframes

### Main goals

Understanding the core concepts of the 3d animation world. Instead of working with imported ready-made objects and animation tracks, I tried to find a pure three.js way to do things.

### [deployed version](https://airdancer.netlify.app/)

## Setup

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
